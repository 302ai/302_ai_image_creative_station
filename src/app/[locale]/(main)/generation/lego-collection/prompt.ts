Classic LEGO doll style, a miniature scene - an animal standing next to me. The color scheme of this animal matches mine.

Please create this animal based on your understanding of me (you can choose any animal you think is suitable for me, whether it is real, surreal, or fantasy, as long as you feel it matches my temperament).

The entire scene is set within a transparent glass cube, with a minimalist backdrop.

The base of the miniature scene is matte black, decorated with silver, with a simple and fashionable style.

There is an elegant carved label on the base, with delicate serif font and the name of the animal written on it.

The bottom design cleverly incorporates biological classification information similar to that displayed in natural history museums, presented in a finely etched manner.

The overall composition is like a high-end collectible artwork: carefully crafted, curated, and meticulously lit.

The key to composition is balance. The background is a gradient color, transitioning from dark to light (colors are selected based on the main color tone).`;
