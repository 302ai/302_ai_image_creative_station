A highly realistic and detailed packaging image of bubble wrap pills. Each pill represents a different food, which includes ${food}.
All pills are sealed in glossy transparent blister shells, with a silver aluminum foil base with fine diagonal lines as the background. The overall visual style is a minimalist commercial product photography style, using soft ambient lighting and a neutral beige background to highlight the main body of the pill.
